This is the beginning of a larger project intended to be used to automate log ins via the command line for use of services like OSINT or Shodan that require getting and inputting your API keys from the web browser. It is just for saving time in the beginning of your programs. It also saves some data for my own research purposes. Please upload any improvements to this code and thank you.
